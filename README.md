# Doodily Doodle
Graphic Editor.

#About 

Doodily Doodle is a graphic editor that allows you to draw images, save them, load them, play back the drawing in the order you drew them and much more.
It has been built as an assignment for CS349 as a part of my Software Engineering degree in University of Waterloo. Run the app and draw away! If you want to 
play the drawings in the order you drew them, press "play button". Color of the brush as well as its thickness is easily customizable on the left panel.
